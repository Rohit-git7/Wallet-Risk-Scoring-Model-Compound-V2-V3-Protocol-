## 1. Data Collection Method

Implemented controlled synthetic data generation to create realistic Compound protocol transaction patterns with known ground truth labels for supervised learning.

### Data Specifications:
- **Volume:** 1,144 transactions across 103 unique wallet addresses
- **Time Range:** 6-month historical window with proper distribution
- **Risk Distribution:** 20% high-risk, 50% medium-risk, 30% low-risk wallets
- **Protocol Coverage:** Compound V2 and V3 tokens (cUSDC, cETH, cDAI, cUSDT, cWBTC)

### Transaction Attributes:
- **Actions:** Supply, withdraw, borrow, repay operations
- **Amounts:** Log-normal distribution ($50-$50,000) reflecting real DeFi usage patterns
- **Success Rates:** Varied by risk profile (95% low-risk, 82% medium-risk, 65% high-risk)
- **Gas Patterns:** Risk-correlated gas pricing behaviour
- **Temporal Patterns:** Realistic transaction frequency distributions

> **Note:** We have implemented synthetic data generation because it enables controlled training of our model with ground truth labels while maintaining realistic behavioural patterns. When we'll be doing the production deployment we can seamlessly integrate real blockchain data through API endpoints.

## 2. Feature Selection Rationale

### 48 Features in Total:

#### Financial Risk Indicators (12 features)
- **Borrow-to-Supply Ratio:** Primary leverage exposure metric
- **Repay-to-Borrow Ratio:** Debt servicing capability indicator
- **Withdraw-to-Supply Ratio:** Liquidity pressure measurement
- **Volume Metrics:** Total, average, maximum transaction amounts
- **Amount Volatility:** Standard deviation and coefficient of variation

#### Behavioural Pattern Features (15 features)
- **Transaction Success Rate:** Operational competency indicator
- **Failed Transaction Ratio:** Stress and capability measurement
- **Consecutive Failures:** Risk momentum indicator
- **Large Transaction Ratio:** Irregular behaviour detection
- **Gas Usage Patterns:** Cost efficiency and urgency indicators

#### Activity and Engagement Features (10 features)
- **Transaction Frequency:** Activity consistency measurement
- **Activity Span:** Engagement duration analysis
- **Recent Activity Ratio:** Current engagement level
- **Token Diversity:** Portfolio diversification indicator
- **Token Concentration:** Over-exposure risk measurement

#### Advanced Temporal Features (8 features)
- **Amount Trend:** Transaction size evolution over time
- **Success Rate Trend:** Performance trajectory analysis
- **Transaction Frequency Variance:** Consistency measurement
- **Seasonal Patterns:** Time-based behaviour analysis

#### Binary Risk Flags (8 features)
- **High Leverage Risk:** Borrow-to-supply > 0.7
- **Poor Repayment Risk:** Repay-to-borrow < 0.8
- **High Failure Risk:** Success rate < 80%
- **Low Activity Risk:** Transaction frequency < 0.1/day
- **High Gas Risk:** Above 75th percentile gas usage
- **Concentration Risk:** Token concentration > 80%
- **Volatility Risk:** Above 75th percentile amount variance
- **Large Transaction Risk:** Large transaction ratio > 30%

**Feature Selection Criteria:** Each feature directly relates to DeFi lending risk factors, has statistical correlation with historical default patterns, and is robust across different market conditions and time periods.

## 3. Normalization Method

### Ratio Feature Handling
- **Bounded Ratios:** Applied log transformation for highly skewed ratios
- **Infinite Values:** Capped extreme ratios at 99th percentile
- **Missing Values:** Filled with domain-appropriate defaults (e.g., repay ratio = 1.0 if no borrowing)

### Binary Feature Encoding
- **Risk Flags:** Already in 0/1 format, no transformation needed
- **Categorical Features:** One-hot encoding for token preferences

### Temporal Feature Normalization
- **Time-based Features:** Min-max scaling to range
- **Trend Features:** Standardized slopes and correlation coefficients

**Rationale:** StandardScaler ensures all features contribute equally to logistic regression while preserving relative relationships and this approach handles the wide variance in DeFi transaction amounts and frequencies.

## 4. Scoring Method

### Score Interpretation
| Score Range | Risk Level | Description |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| 0-200 | Low Risk | Conservative users, high success rates, low leverage |
| 201-400 | Low-Medium Risk | Stable patterns, occasional issues |
| 401-600 | Medium Risk | Moderate leverage, mixed performance |
| 601-800 | High Risk | High leverage, frequent failures, poor repayment |
| 801-1000 | Very High Risk | Extreme leverage, operational issues, default indicators |

### Score Generation Formula
After probability calibration
calibrated_probs = calibrated_model.predict_proba(X)

Percentile-based scoring for balanced distribution
percentile_ranks = np.argsort(np.argsort(calibrated_probs[:, 2])) / len(calibrated_probs)
risk_scores = np.round(percentile_ranks * 1000).astype(int)

## 5. Risk Indicators

### Primary Risk Factors (Evidence-Based)

#### 🔴 Leverage Risk (Weight: 25%)
- **Metric:** Borrow-to-supply ratio > 0.7
- **Justification:** High leverage amplifies market risk exposure. DeFi protocols typically liquidate positions above 80% loan-to-value ratios. Wallets consistently operating near these thresholds face liquidation risk during market volatility.

#### 🟡 Repayment Behavior Risk (Weight: 20%)
- **Metric:** Repay-to-borrow ratio < 0.8
- **Justification:** Poor debt servicing indicates financial stress or strategic default risk. Traditional credit scoring heavily weights payment history as the strongest predictor of future defaults.

#### 🟠 Operational Risk (Weight: 20%)
- **Metric:** Transaction success rate < 80%
- **Justification:** High failure rates indicate technical incompetence, insufficient funds, or rushed decision-making under stress. Operational failures often precede financial defaults.

#### 🔵 Activity Pattern Risk (Weight: 15%)
- **Metric:** Low activity or irregular patterns
- **Justification:** Abandoned positions or erratic behavior suggests poor risk management. Consistent engagement indicates active position management and risk awareness.

#### 🟢 Liquidity Risk (Weight: 10%)
- **Metric:** High withdraw-to-supply ratios
- **Justification:** Frequent withdrawals relative to deposits indicate liquidity pressure. This pattern often precedes forced liquidations when users cannot meet margin requirements.

#### 🟣 Diversification Risk (Weight: 10%)
- **Metric:** Token concentration > 80%
- **Justification:** Concentration in single assets amplifies idiosyncratic risk. Diversified positions provide natural hedging against individual token volatility.
